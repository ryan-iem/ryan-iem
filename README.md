### Motivated, adventurous, and eager to learn.

After starting my career as a Technology Intern at National Australia Bank, I made the difficult decision to say goodbye and pursue a lifelong dream of mine: living in Japan and learning Japanese. Through only self-study and immersion, I was able to improve my Japanese from a complete beginner to near business-level proficiency (~N2 level). What was originally a 2-year plan ended up becoming three years thanks to the opportunity to represent Australia at Expo 2025 Osaka - a once-in-a-lifetime experience that not only further strengthened my Japanese proficiency, but also my adaptability, communication skills, and global perspective.

Despite my adventure in Japan, my passion for Information Technology never faded. The field has always held a special place in my heart since I was young, and after taking some time to pursue my lifelong dream, I’m now content with my Japanese proficiency and ready to once again take on the world of IT.

You’ll find me **motivated** about IT, **adventurous** in my problem-solving and **eager to learn** the latest technologies. Then, outside of work, I'm a big fan of music, Japanese literature, whisky, cafes and cats. 

P.S. I can probably give you a good Japanese recommendation too 😸

Willing to relocate.
